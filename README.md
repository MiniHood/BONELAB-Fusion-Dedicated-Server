## Setup
You must have the following
- Steam
- Sandboxie Plus
- Bonelab
- Flatplayer

This is a brief guide on how to setup a server.
- Create a new bonelab directory with bonelab inside of it just for this. This will be the directory for hosting your server. Set it up as you would normal bonelab. I didn't like the hassle so I used a pirated copy of bonelab for the server.
- Run steam in a sandboxie and login. This will be the account hosting your server, it can host multiple servers.
- Build the bonelab fusion dedicated server's source code.
- Place LabFusion.dll & FlatPlayer.dll (you must get this elsewhere) in your new bonelabs mods.
- Place the .bat file below into your main directory, beside BONELAB.exe.
- Run the .bat file from the same sandboxie group you're running steam inside.
- Your server should be started

```bat
@echo off
BONELAB_Steam_Windows64.exe -batchmode -nographics
```

## Documentation
For installation, source code setup, documentation, help with Marrow SDK integration, and more, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion/wiki).

## Networking
This mod is networked and built around Steam, but the networking system can be swapped out using a Networking Layer.

## Modules
Fusion supports a system called "Modules". This allows other code mods to add on and sync their own events in Fusion.
Fusion also has an SDK for integrating features into Marrowâ„¢ SDK items, maps, and more.

## Lists
Fusion pulls a few lists from another [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/Fusion-Lists/) so that certain limits can be remotely updated.

These lists include:
- Global Ban List
- Profanity List
- Global Mod Blacklist

Note that additions to these lists are only for extreme cases. If you would like to see the criteria required to be added to these lists, or view what is currently on these
lists, you can [visit the repository.](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/Fusion-Lists/)
